# Ship-Landing
A project I had an idea to do after hearing about a coding project my grandad did years ago in visual. It's basically a recreation of the application he made but in python and with my own pixel art to make it a bit more interesting visually.

The game is basically the player trying to not smack into the moon and land safely. The player has a fuel level which depletes over use of thrust, and the fuel has weight which effects how quick the ship begins to fall as well as how hard it is too slow the ship from falling. There is a GUI to ask if you would like to replay, which is interacted with using buttons (not very well done buttons, but still buttons).

TO-DO:
 - Make some random text scroll across the screen
