# Ship-Landing
A project I had an idea to do after hearing about a coding project my grandad did years ago in visual. It's basically a recreation of the application he made but in python and with my own pixel art to make it a bit more interesting visually.

TO-DO:
 - Make some random text scroll across the screen
 - Make a starting GUI with buttons that say "Play" and "Exit"
 - Make a GUI appear that asks the player to "Replay" or "Exit" when they win or lose
 - Add code which recognises when the player wins or loses
 - Add fuel and weight to the game
